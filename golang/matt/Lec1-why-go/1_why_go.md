 1. Why is go preferred ??


 ------ Simplicity 

 - programs must be easy to read. If the programming language is too complicated then the language itself becomes the problem. Go is known for its simplicity. Many features like overriding, classes etc are not in go but thats what makes it simple and easy to learn.

 - Go is made to combine the ease of programming of an interpreted/ dynamically typed language with the safety & efficiency of compiled languages.

 - Languages like c++ and java get dumped with newer features in every release that can make software incompatible for newer versions. Go release focus on efficiency rather than newer features. Improvement of garbage collection etc. They do provide newer features but not very frequently as the language is already kinda perfect.

 ------- New age language 

- if you see year since 2005 cpu cores just increaase but performance per cpu is nearly same. All languages famous ones like c++, java, js, python etc were made before 2005. Go has been made after putting into concideration concurrency and handling multiple cpus to boost performance which is a need in this new era.


-------- Built for cloud

- easy to deploy.

- secure as go doesnt need a jvm to execute or third party stuff that reduces the vulnerabilities.
