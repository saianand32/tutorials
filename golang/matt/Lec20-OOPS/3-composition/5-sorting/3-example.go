/*
** Explanation of the sort.Interface:**

In Go, the `sort` package provides a general sorting mechanism, but it requires that the collection being sorted implements the `sort.Interface`. The `sort.Interface` is an interface that defines three methods that any type can implement to be sortable by the `sort` package:

1. **Len() int**: This method returns the number of elements in the collection. It tells the sorting algorithm how many elements there are to sort.

2. **Swap(i, j int)**: This method swaps the elements at indices `i` and `j`. The sorting algorithm uses this to change the order of elements during the sorting process.

3. **Less(i, j int) bool**: This method compares two elements, the ones at indices `i` and `j`, and returns `true` if the element at `i` should come before the element at `j`. This method defines the "ordering" or "sorting" logic. If `Less(i, j)` returns `true`, the sorting algorithm considers `i` to be less than `j`, meaning `i` will appear earlier in the sorted slice.

For example:
- The `Len()` method simply returns the number of elements in the slice.
- The `Swap()` method exchanges the positions of two elements in the slice.
- The `Less()` method defines the sorting order, such as comparing organs by name (alphabetically) or by weight (numerically).

The `sort.Sort` function uses the `sort.Interface` methods to sort the collection according to the provided `Less` method. The key idea is that the `sort.Interface` gives `sort.Sort` the ability to sort **any** collection that implements this interface, making Goâ€™s sorting mechanism very flexible and reusable.

In this example, we define two custom types: `OrgansByName` and `OrgansByWeight`, both of which implement the `sort.Interface` for sorting `Organs` by `Name` and `Weight`, respectively.
