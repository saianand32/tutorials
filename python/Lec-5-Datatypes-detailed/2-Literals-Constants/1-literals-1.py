# Literals in programming are fixed values that are directly written into the code. 
# These values represent data in its simplest form and are assigned directly to variables or used in expressions. 
# Unlike variables or expressions, literals do not change and are often categorized by their type, 
# such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, strings, etc.

#so if u take input thoise are not literals but directly assigned variables are literals.

# int literals 
a = 125
b = 1_32_000 #same as 1,32,000 made easy to understand but instead of comma we use _

#float literals
a = 123.99
b = 1_23.67
c = 1_23.67e3

#bool literals
a = True
b = True

#str literals
a = "john"

# complex literals
a = 7+4j
b = 70_000+8_000j

# this is same in golang as well 70_000
